## Running the code

Suppose that you want to run the code in a file named `name.f90`. In
your terminal, do the following:

1. Compile the code to an executable `name.exe`:

    ```bash
    gfortran name.f90 -o name.exe
    ```

2. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./name.exe
    ```

3. Enjoy the output.
